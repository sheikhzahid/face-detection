# Face-Detection
### Overview
Here I have created a real time face recognition / detection app using the webcam and a JavaScript library called [face-api](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/#face-apijs) which uses TensoFlow. With this, not only are we able to detect faces but we are also able to define key facial features, detect expressions and moods, and approximate the person's age as well.
### face-api.js
The face-api.js JavaScript module implements convolutional neural networks to solve for face detection and recognition of faces and face landmarks. The face-api.js leverages TensorFlow.js and is optimized for the desktop and mobile web. There are several models available with face-api.js, including face detection, face landmark detection, face recognition, facial expression recognition, age estimation, and gender recognition. To get started with face-api.js, developers can include the latest JavaScript resource of face-api.js or install it via npm: 
```
npm i face-api.js
```
JavaScript face recognition API for the browser and nodejs implemented on top of tensorflow.js core

_"happy"? No kidding._

_The age detection algorithm is not up to the mark as it always thinks I am a decade older than my actual age. Or maybe, it's just the beard._

_Very, very sad, indeed._
### Live Server
Now, after you have coded in to you preferred code editor, you will need to `Go Live`. In order to do so, install a Live Server Web Extension, like [ritwickdey.liveserver](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/) on VSCode editor, right click on a HTML file from Explorer Window & click to `Open with Live Server`.

Well, that's it. My first try at JS.
